# SoleMate

## Description

SoleMate is a website that allows users to submit shoes, as well as some detailed information about the shoe. Users can submit a rating and optional text review for any shoe entered in our site's database. The submitter of the shoe will receive an email whenever their shoe is reviewed by someone. Users can also upvote or downvote a review, and the shoe's reviews will be sorted on the page by their vote score.
