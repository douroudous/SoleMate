# SoleMate

## Description

Heroku Link: https://solemate.herokuapp.com/

SoleMate is a website that allows users to post detailed descriptions of shoes. Users can also submit ratings and reviews for any shoe in our site's database. A user will receive an email whenever another user reviews a shoe they've posted. Users can also upvote or downvote a review, and that shoe's reviews will be sorted on the page by their vote score.
